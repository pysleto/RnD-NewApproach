- How does disclosed rnd and oprev in subs compare with rnd and oprev in parents
- How much disclosed sub rnd is embedded in keyword matching subs and not accounted for in subs final rnd
- How much disclosed parent rnd is embedded in parent that have a potential keyword match but have no subsidiaries

- Select top 10 parents in each cluster and consolidate oprev, exposure and rnd trends over range_ys
- Distribution and cumulative distribution functions for parent and subs (rnd x oprev or market cap?) by world_player

- Ex-post exposure global and by world_player

- collect M&A data from ORBIS

- Check that selected parent ids based on rnd_limit is representative of total rnd in each world region

- GUI to prompt user for use_case and place instead of cfg.init hard coding
- Abstract main.py with object class and functions for patterns
- Progress bars for reading input files by chunks

- Modify n/a value format to #N/A in every .csv output so it can be understood by excel

- Implement .index over dataframes

- Gather all input.py in a module
